# Automating Excel Data Entry

In this project, we will be using
the [Home Base API](https://app.joinhomebase.com/api-docs#!/timeclock/postTimeclockStartBreak) to pull the time report
data for the Ace Party Rental employees. Once we've obtained this data, we will populate the data into a template Excel
file and save it in a folder that is easily accessible to Zach.

## Getting Started
